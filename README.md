## What is Java (Swing)? ðŸ¤”

- Java is a high-level, object-oriented programming language that is designed to be platform-independent, allowing developers to write code once and run it anywhere. It was created by Sun Microsystems in the mid-1990s and has since become one of the most widely used programming languages in the world.
- Java Swing is a part of Java's Java Foundation Classes (JFC) and is a lightweight graphical user interface (GUI) toolkit used to create desktop applications. It provides a set of predefined components like buttons, text fields, labels, tables, and more, enabling developers to build rich user interfaces.
